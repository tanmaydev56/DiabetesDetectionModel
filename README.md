# DiabetesDetectionModel

A machine learning project for detecting diabetes from tabular medical data using Python. This repository contains code for data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and saved model artifacts. It is designed to be a self-contained starting point for experiments and deployments (local scripts, notebooks, or light APIs).

Project overview
----------------
DiabetesDetectionModel aims to provide a clear, reproducible pipeline to build and evaluate models that predict whether a person has diabetes based on tabular medical features (blood glucose, BMI, age, etc.). The repo uses standard ML libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, optionally XGBoost/lightgbm) and documents the preprocessing steps, feature engineering, modeling choices, and evaluation approach.

This repository is intended for:
- Data scientists learning an end-to-end ML workflow
- Developers prototyping a diabetes detection model for research or demonstration
- Educators demonstrating classification pipelines with real-world considerations (metrics, imbalance, explainability)

Features
--------
- Data loading and cleaning utilities
- Preprocessing pipeline: missing value handling, scaling, encoding (if needed)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) guidance and example plots
- Training scripts for classical ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation scripts and metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC, confusion matrix)
- Model saving & loading (joblib/pickle)
- Example Jupyter notebooks showing step-by-step workflow
- Instruction to deploy model locally (simple Flask or FastAPI example template)
- Clear README and contribution guidelines

Getting started
---------------

Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (3.9/3.10 recommended)
- pip
- Recommended: create & use a virtual environment (venv, conda)

Install dependencies
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/tanmaydev56/DiabetesDetectionModel.git
   cd DiabetesDetectionModel

2. Create & activate a virtual environment (example using venv):
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows PowerShell

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't have a requirements.txt, a minimal set is:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib
- jupyter
Optional:
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- flask or fastapi[all] (for lightweight serving)

Dataset
-------
This repository expects a tabular dataset (CSV) containing features relevant to diabetes prediction and a binary target column (e.g., "Outcome" or "diabetes"). A commonly used dataset is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIMA) which includes features such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0: no diabetes, 1: diabetes)

Place your dataset CSV in data/raw/ and name it diabetes.csv (or update the path used by the loader). For sensitive or private datasets, do not commit them to the repository.

Usage
-----

Quick start (run the notebook)
1. Start Jupyter:
   jupyter notebook
2. Open notebooks/eda_and_training.ipynb and follow the cells. Notebooks show EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

Train from scratch (script)
- To train a model with default settings:
  python src/train.py --data path/to/data/raw/diabetes.csv --target Outcome --output models/diabetes_model.joblib

- Common train.py CLI options (example):
  --data: path to CSV
  --target: name of target column (default: Outcome)
  --model: model to train (logistic, rf, xgb)
  --test-size: fraction for test split (default 0.2)
  --random-state: random seed

Evaluate a saved model
- Example:
  python src/evaluate.py --model models/diabetes_model.joblib --data path/to/data/raw/diabetes.csv --target Outcome

Make predictions with a saved model
- Example:
  python src/predict.py --model models/diabetes_model.joblib --input samples_to_predict.csv --output preds.csv

Modeling details
----------------
Algorithms included (examples)
- Logistic Regression — good baseline, interpretable coefficients
- Random Forest — robust tree-based ensemble
- XGBoost / LightGBM — gradient boosting for higher performance

Preprocessing
- Handle missing values: imputation (median/mean), domain-specific replacement (e.g., 0s in biological measurements may indicate missing)
- Scaling: StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler for numeric features (especially for algorithms that require scaling)
- Class imbalance handling: stratified split, class weighting, or resampling (SMOTE/undersampling) as needed

Evaluation metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score (recommended where false negatives are important)
- ROC AUC (overall discrimination)
- Confusion Matrix (inspection of error types)

How to contribute
-----------------
Contributions are welcome. Steps:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a feature branch:
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-thing
3. Implement your changes, add tests where appropriate.
4. Run tests locally.
5. Open a pull request describing your changes.

Guidelines:
- Keep code style consistent (PEP8). Use black/isort if configured.
- Write clear commit messages.
- Add / update a notebook demonstrating changes if they affect modeling or preprocessing.

Tests
-----
No automated tests are required for a demo repo, but it's recommended to:
- Add unit tests for data loading, preprocessing transformations, and prediction pipeline (pytest)
- Add integration tests that run training on a small sample dataset and assert outputs exist

Reproducibility & tips
----------------------
- Set a random seed where applicable for reproducible results (train/test split, model randomness).
- Save the exact environment (pip freeze > requirements.txt or use poetry/conda env).
- Log hyperparameters and metrics (e.g., with MLflow or a lightweight experiment log) to compare runs.
- For production, consider model monitoring, data schema validation, and safe-serving endpoints.
